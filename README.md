## Pneumonia
Pneumonia is a respiratory infection which affects all people at various ages. Pneumonia remains as one of the significant health concerns in the contemporary world. Early detection of disease is crucial to save the individual from life threats. Although different diagnosis methods exist to detect the infection which is caused by either bacteria or viruses, chest x-ray imagining is the most common method worldwide. Since visual inspection may not be always effective, this paper approaches the problem as image classification problem and applies different CNN architectures to predict the disease from chest x-ray images.
